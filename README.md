# Stagekit

Stagekit is a 3D-printable, completely hand-solderable diy lighting previs kit. 

It consists of various fixtures, truss elements, and set dressing pieces, all modelled at a fairly accurate 1:10 scale. The truss pieces are modelled after standard Eurotruss, and the lights after various fixtures, but due to design requirements, sizing and design liberties have had to be taken. 

## Fixtures

Currently, Stagekit has 3 fixture designs available, but more designs are coming in the future.

| Fixture     | Estimated Material Cost (USD) | Images                               |
|-------------|-------------------------------| ------------------------------------ |
| RGB Par     | $4                            | ![RGB Par](/img/rgbpar-complete.png) |
| RGB Tube    | $5                            | ![RGB Tube](img/rgbtube-full.png)    |
| RGB Blinder | $4                            | ![RGB Blinder](img/blinder-full.png) |

The RGB Blinder and RGB Tube both utilize neopixels, and the RGB Par uses a RGB Led. All fixtures use an ATTiny85 acting as an i2c slave, controlled by a RPi Zero 2 W or other i2c capable controller. The controller acts as an art net node, and sends i2c over 4 wire Molex Picoblade connectors, daisy chained together akin to DMX.

## Truss Pieces

There are currently four main truss pieces available, with more options in the future again.
All parts should be easily printable, and there are versions of each file which should be able to be printed without supports.

## Firmware

To program the ATTiny85 chips, you will need either a dedicated programmer or an Arduino Uno or similar. The source code for all of the lights can be found in the firmware directory.

Unfortunately, due to size and budget limitations, light addresses must be hardcoded into each chip individually. This means that when flashing firmware, ensure each light has a different address assigned, by editing the `.ino` file and changing the value of `I2C_SLAVE_ADDRESS` to any unused value between 0x01 and 0x7F before programming.

PCB Source files can be found in the respective folder (Blinder, RGB Par, RGB Tube) and all 3D models can be found inside the cad folder.

## BOM

Better formatted BOM's are also available at [this google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1baBuS65jXXmk7wej5hXxSFTJ-pqP7fWwTh28TKW3xLs).
